By presenting my research and prototypes to the public\n            early in the development process, I was able to identify my value\n            proposition and validate my idea before introducing it to the market\n            for public adoption.\n          </p>\n\n          <br />\n          <br />\n\n          <center>\n            <img\n              src={img16}\n              alt=\"pillbox website\"\n              style={{ maxWidth: '90%' }}\n            />\n          </center>\n\n          <br />\n          <br />\n\n          <p>\n            Lastly, I facilitated a product demo workshop with a small group of\n            participants. Participants were offered the prototype as a tool to\n            assist them in their actions. The product's usability was then\n            recorded and measured across 5 domains as shown below.\n          </p>\n\n          <br />\n          <br />\n\n          <center>\n            <img\n              src={img17}\n              alt=\"usability workshop\"\n              style={{ maxWidth: '90%' }}\n            />\n          </center>\n\n          <br />\n          <br />\n\n          <hr />\n\n          <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n          <p>\n            This research project addressed the main objectives I set out to\n            achieve. Although faced with a few limitations, I adopted a design\n            thinking methodology to tackle a healthcare environment challenge.\n            This human-centred approach helped build a deep understanding of the\n            target audiences' challenges and needs, resulting in the development\n            of a user-friendly and effective solution.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The digital pillbox solution, Pillbox Health, is by no means a\n            finished product. Although preliminary usability and desirability\n            tests yielded favourable feedback, there remains scope for further\n            testing and refinement of this technology.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I hope that this study's insights and results will prompt future\n            research and development in this area and promote the use of design\n            thinking in more healthcare challenges in the future.\n          </p>\n\n          {/* \n          Comment */}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default ProjectPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
